For the past 8 years, I've been developing all sorts of websites with WordPress. According to a [recent statistic by W3Techs](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all), about 29% of all websites on the internet are built using WordPress. That's a **HUGE** number, and for pretty good reason. WordPress has an extensive community backing it, with tons of themes and plugins for almost any website you can think of. It's relatively easy to use and best of all, it's free. What's not to like?

The landscape of today's front end development scene is constantly changing and unfortunately for WordPress, it's no longer the new hotness. Everybody is riding the javascript train, with the React.js framework reigning supreme. WordPress is seen by most developers as an old technology (it's been around since 2003), and it's seemly plagued by constant security issues. If you're anything like me, you want to stay relevant and work with the newest, coolest technologies.
