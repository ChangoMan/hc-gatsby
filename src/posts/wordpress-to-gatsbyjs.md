For the past 8+ years, my go-to weapon of choice when developing a website has been WordPress. According to a [recent statistic by W3Techs](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all), about 29% of all websites on the internet are built using this popular CMS. That's a **HUGE** number, and for pretty good reason. WordPress has an extensive community backing it, with tons of themes and plugins for almost any website you can think of. It's relatively easy to use and best of all, it's free. What's not to like?

The landscape of today's front end development scene is constantly changing and unfortunately for WordPress, it's no longer the new hotness. Everybody is riding the JavaScript train, with the React.js framework reigning supreme. WordPress is seen by a lot of developers as an old technology (it's been around since 2003), and it's many plugins are plagued by constant security issues. If you're anything like me, you want to stay relevant and work with the newest, coolest technologies. Allow me introduce you to [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

<h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">About Gatsby.js</h2>

[Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) is a static site generator, which means that the websites it produces doesn't require any sort of database. All the pages and blog posts are generated for you as regular HTML files and you can host them pretty much anywhere! There is no admin interface or user logins to manage. This is unlike WordPress, which requires a server that runs PHP and a MySQL database to house all the pages and posts. Having all the pages readily available makes a website much faster.

When I was first looking into static site generators, I was surprised by the [variety available](https://www.staticgen.com/). What makes Gatsby different from these other generators is that it uses trendy JavaScript technologies like Node.js, React.js, and Webpack. This makes it a great tool to not only build fast websites, but also get more practice and exposure to the modern JavaScript front end.
