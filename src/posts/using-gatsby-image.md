With the rise of mobile, the optimization of images on a website is more important than ever. If a site is image heavy, it's always a good idea to lazy load images that are further down the page to speed up the initial render. However, optimizing and implementing lazy loading images can be pretty time consuming. [Gatsby-image](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-image) is a React component that works with Gatsby.js to give you an easy way to load and optimize images on a static website.
